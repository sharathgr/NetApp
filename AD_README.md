Yes, you can run Ansible playbooks that manage Windows hosts, including tasks involving Active Directory operations, from a Linux control node. Ansible provides support for managing Windows hosts through the use of WinRM (Windows Remote Management) protocol and PowerShell.

Hereâ€™s what you need to ensure for running Ansible playbooks that interact with Windows AD from a Linux server:

1. **WinRM Configuration**: Ensure that WinRM is configured and enabled on the target Windows hosts. Ansible uses WinRM to communicate with and execute commands on Windows machines remotely.

2. **Python on Windows**: Ansible requires Python to be installed and accessible on the Windows hosts. Python 2.7.x or Python 3.x should be installed and added to the PATH environment variable.

3. **Ansible Configuration**:
   - Install the `pywinrm` Python module on your Ansible control node (`pip install pywinrm`).
   - Configure Ansible to use WinRM as the connection plugin in your inventory file or in group/host variables:

     ```ini
     [windows_hosts]
     windows-server1
     windows-server2

     [windows_hosts:vars]
     ansible_connection=winrm
     ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore
     ```

     - `ansible_connection=winrm`: Specifies that WinRM should be used for connections to these hosts.
     - `ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore`: Disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for WinRM connections. Adjust this based on your security policies.

4. **Playbook Execution**: Once configured, you can execute your playbook from the Linux control node as usual. Ansible will use WinRM to connect to the Windows hosts and execute the tasks defined in your playbook, including those interacting with Active Directory.

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory_file -u username -k
   ```

   - Replace `playbook.yml` with the name of your playbook file.
   - `-i inventory_file`: Specify the path to your Ansible inventory file containing the Windows hosts.
   - `-u username`: Username for authentication (ensure it has sufficient permissions on Windows).
   - `-k`: Prompt for the SSH password (or use `-K` for sudo password if using `--become`).

By following these steps, you can effectively manage Windows AD objects, including resetting computer object passwords, from a Linux-based Ansible control node.
